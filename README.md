# Covid-19-Self-Oraganizing-Maps
Analysis on Covid-19 with self organizing Maps.

The Self-Organizing Map is one of the most popular neural network models. The Self-Organizing Map defines an ordered mapping, a kind of projection from a set of given data items onto a regular, usually two-dimensional grid.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome.

As a case study that shows how to use self organizing maps to compare countries in pandemic situations.Based on the great no of features(eg. Total cases, population, test per million, daily cases, etc.) the SOM illustrates rather refined relationships between the countries two-dimensionally.This method has various applications.

This case study is done on the Data last updated on 15 April 2020.

This case study represents mapping of various countries on the basis of covid-19 data set. This is done by making a machine learning model by using self organizing maps. Furthermore this map will provide the insights about the global pandemic situation.
